When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a project that others can contribute to.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone else made a change and pushed it, that change might mess up the code that I've been working on. If I pull them manually, then I can see what changes were made (if any) and decide which changes I want to keep.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone that is made on GitHub. Once made, I can access it only on GitHub unless I clone it to my computer using a pull request. This is used when there are multiple contributors to a project.

A clone is made locally on my own computer from another source. It is a copy of the original files and changes made to my copy don't affect the source that the clone was made from. This is used when I want to make changes to a project that won't be used by another project or anyone else.

A branch is a clone that is made from a specific commit and given a new name. This is used when I want to try something out that I don't want to affect the last commit that was made to the main project.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It makes merging a new version created locally with the remote version easier. By having the most recent commit of the remote version on my hard drive, when I make a change to a file will affect the most recent version and pushing that to the remote will have fewer conflicts.
