What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A folder is set up that contains the information about commits and files. No commits are made because you have to save the commits to create them.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area keeps track of which files you want to track changes to. The working directory is where the files are located, and the repository keeps a history of changes made to the files.
